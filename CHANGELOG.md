### Breaking Changes
- Configuration file format has been extended (backward compatible for basic usage)
- Some internal APIs have been restructured for better modularity
- Minimum supported features now include optional TUI dependencies

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-12

### Added
- Support for `total_tokens` field in token calculation for better accuracy with GLM-4.5 and similar providers
- Proper Git repository detection using `git rev-parse --git-dir`
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements for Windows path handling
- Pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting
- **Static Linux binary**: Added musl-based static binary for universal Linux compatibility without glibc dependencies

### Changed
- **Token calculation priority**: `total_tokens` → Claude format → OpenAI format → fallback
- **Display formatting**: Removed redundant ".0" from integer percentages and token counts
  - `0.0%` → `0%`, `25.0%` → `25%`, `50.0k` → `50k`
- **CI/CD**: Updated GitHub Actions to use Ubuntu 22.04 for Linux builds and ubuntu-latest for Windows cross-compilation
- **Binary distribution**: Now provides two Linux options - dynamic (glibc) and static (musl) binaries
- **Version management**: Unified version number using `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`

### Fixed
- Git segment now properly hides for non-Git directories instead of showing misleading "detached" status
- Windows Git repository path handling issues by removing overly aggressive path sanitization
- GitHub Actions runner compatibility issues (updated to supported versions: ubuntu-22.04 for Linux, ubuntu-latest for Windows)
- **Git version compatibility**: Added fallback to `git symbolic-ref` for Git versions < 2.22 when `--show-current` is not available

### Removed
- Path sanitization function that could break Windows paths in Git operations

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-11

- Command-line configuration options
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### Technical Details
- Context limit: 200,000 tokens
